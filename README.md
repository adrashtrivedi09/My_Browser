# My_Browser

I created my own web browser using python modules it actually works like google but it is a personalized experience of browsing over internet. It consist of following features:
Home Button: This button must-have capability to take the user directly to the home page.
Forward Button: This button will take the user to the next site.
Back Button: This button will take the user to previously visited websites.
Refresh Button: It will have the capability to refresh the content of the site.
